# Comments in Code for contributions by Vishal N (20BCE1043)

This documentation is to showcase well commented code as part of DA-3.

1. **Cipher class**

    ```python
    class Cipher:
        '''
        This class is used to control all ciphers. You can create any cipher by passing it's name and references to it's encryption and decryption function as parameters to this class.
        '''
        def __init__(self):
            # Initialization function that takes in encryption function, decryption function and a description of the cipher
            # This raises an exception if the testing function fails to verify the encryption and decryption functions

        def testing(self) -> bool:
            # A testing function to verify if encryption and decryption are working correctly.
            # It  automatically encrypts and then decrypts the word "vishal". If the output is not the same as "vishal", it returns false.
            # If it is same, it returns true

        def verify(self, plain_text, encrypted_message, is_encrypted):
            # A function to verify if an encrypted message matches the plain text
            # if the message is not encrypted, return True if it matches the plain text
            # Otherwise, return True if the decrypted message (in lowercase) matches the plain text (in lowercase)
    ```

2. **Blowfish encryption and decryption functions**

    1. Encryption

        ```python
        def blowfish_encrypt(plaintext):
            '''
            Create a new instance of the Blowfish cipher with the provided key and ECB mode
            '''
            # Pad the plaintext to match the block size of the cipher
            # Encrypt the padded plaintext using the Blowfish cipher
            # Encode the encrypted plaintext using base64 and return the result
        ```

    2. Decryption

        ```python
        def blowfish_decrypt(encoded_plaintext):
            '''
            Create a new instance of the Blowfish cipher with the provided key and ECB mode
            '''
            # Decode the base64-encoded encrypted plaintext
            # Decrypt the encrypted plaintext using the Blowfish cipher
            # Unpad the decrypted plaintext and decode it to return the result
        ```

3. **Caesar cipher encryption and decryption functions**

    1. Encryption

        ```python
        def caesar_encrypt(message):
            """
            Encrypts a message using the Caesar cipher with the given key.
            """
            # Check if character is a letter
            # Convert to uppercase
            # Apply shift based on key
            # Add shifted character to result
            # Add non-letter character as is
        ```

    2. Decryption

        ```python
            def caesar_decrypt(message):
            """
            Decrypts a message using the Caesar cipher with the given key.
            """
            # Check if character is a letter
            # Convert to uppercase
            # Apply reverse shift based on key
            # Add shifted character to result
            # Add non-letter character as is
        ```

4. AES encryption and decryption functions

    1. Encryption

        ```python
        def aes_encrypt(message):
            """
            Encrypts a message using the AES algorithm in ECB mode.
            """
            # Create a new AES object with the key and mode
            # Pad the message to a multiple of 16 bytes using spaces
            # Encrypt the padded message using AES
            # Encode the encrypted message in base64 and return as a string
        ```

    2. Decryption
        ```python
        def aes_decrypt(encrypted_message):
            """
            Decrypts an encrypted message using the AES algorithm in ECB mode.
            """
            # Create a new AES object with the key and mode
            # Decode the encrypted message from base64
            # Decrypt the decoded message using AES
            # Remove any trailing whitespace from the decrypted message and return
        ```
