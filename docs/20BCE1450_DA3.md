- `/pyjamas_forms`

    - `app.py`

        i.   This module contains the main application logic and routes.

        ii. The app.py module has the following steps:

        - <b>Loading the config</b> - _import the config.py module that contains the configuration variables such as encryption key, database name, etc._

        - <b>Create the database</b> - _create an instance of the Database class from database.py and pass it the database name from config.py_

        - <b>Create a logger instance for logging purposes </b>- _use the logging module to create a logger object that can log messages to a file or console._

        - <b>Logging each request</b> - _use a decorator function to log each request made to the app with its method, path and status code._

        - <b>Load the configuration file and render the index template </b>- _use the render_template function from flask to load the index.html template and pass it the configuration variables from config.py_

        - <b>Get a form response and encrypts the fields that are to be encrypted </b>- _use the request.form object from flask to get the data from a POST request and use the cryptography module to encrypt some of the fields using the encryption key from config.py_

        - <b>Writes the processed data to the database</b> - _use the write_row method from Database class to write the encrypted data to the database._

        - <b>Gets a form response to be searched for in the database</b> - _use the request.form object from flask to get the data from a POST request and use it as a query for finding a row in the database._

        - <b>Decrypt the rows in database based on encryption key and matches to form response</b> - _use the cryptography module to decrypt some of the fields in each row using the encryption key from config.py and compare them with the query data._

        - <b>Return the row if found </b>- _use the jsonify function from flask to return a JSON response with the row data if found or an error message if not found._

        - <b>Render a UI for searching in the database with the appropriate primary keys and inserting row in database</b> - _use the render_template function from flask to load the search.html template and pass it a list of primary keys that are required for searching in the database._

    - `database.py`

        This module contains the class Database that handles the database operations.

        i. <b>Methods used</b>: 

        - To initialize the database instance with the given name

                 __init__(self, db_name)
        
        - Write a row to the database with the given data dictionary
         
                write_row(self, data)

        - Prints all the rows in the database to the console

                print_all(self)

        - Find operaton on the database, loops through all the encrypted data to find the matching row.

                find(self, query)

            i.  `query`: a dictionary of key-value pairs to search for

            ii. `returns`: a list of rows that match the query or an empty list if none found
