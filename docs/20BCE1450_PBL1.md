## **Outcomes**

The outcome of our project is a secure and user-friendly data storage solution for Python and web developers.With our solution, developers can securely store customer data using various encryption algorithms, such as AES, DES, and Blowfish. Our solution is easy to use and provides a simple and intuitive web interface for developers to manage their stored data.

## _Usage_

- After installing Pyjamas, developers can easily generate forms by navigating to the Pyjamas web interface.
- Developers can choose to hash specific fields in their forms for added security.
- Pyjamas creates separate databases for each form, ensuring data separation and increased security.
- Developers can select any one key as the primary key for the form.
- Pyjamas stores form data in CSV files, which are easily readable and editable.
- Developers can access their form data by navigating to the CSV file for the corresponding form.


We successfully achieved our objectives of developing a secure and easy-to-use data storage solution for Python and web developers. Our solution allows developers to store sensitive data, such as passwords and credit card information,with confidence that the data is protected with strong encryption algorithms. The web interface provides a convenient way for developers to manage their data,allowing them to easily add, update, and delete records.

Our project also focused heavily on security, implementing best practices for encryption and data protection. We prioritized the use of secure encryption algorithms and implemented padding methods to ensure data integrity. Additionally, we utilized industry-standard security measures, to protect against unauthorized access.

Overall, the outcome of our project is a valuable tool for Python and web developers looking to securely store sensitive customer data. Our solution is user-friendly, secure, and easy to integrate into existing workflows, making it an ideal choice for developers looking to prioritize data security.

## _Conclusion_

Pyjamas is a powerful and easy-to-use tool for developers looking to add secure form generation to their projects. Its ability to create separate databases for each form and store data in a one-way, irreversible format makes it an ideal solution for cyber security-focused projects. By using Pyjamas, developers can ensure that their form data is stored securely and separated from other data in their project.
