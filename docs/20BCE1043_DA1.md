# Documentation for contributions by Vishal N (20BCE1043) - DA1

This documentation is for a part of my contributions to the project, which was implementing the security protocols and ciphers that can be used by developers when they integrate Pyjamas.

# How it works?

When developers call the `/submit` endpoint, the following takes place.

![Submit  Image](./images/submit%20diagram.png)

The developer can choose any of the ciphers we have implemented. The ciphers we have implemented are:-

1. AES (can be called with `AES_Cipher.encrypt()`)
2. DES (can be called with `DES_Cipher.encrypt()`)
3. Blowfish (can be called with `Blowfish_Cipher.encrypt()`)
4. Caesar Cipher (can be called with `Caesar_Cipher.encrypt()`)

The ciphers we have integrated are all objects of the `Cipher` class.

The `Cipher` class is:-

```python
    class Cipher:
        def __init__(self, encryption_function, decryption_function, description):
            self.encrypt = encryption_function
            self.decrypt = decryption_function
            self.__doc__ = description
            if not self.testing():
                raise Exception(
                    self.__doc__
                    + " does not seem to be a working decrypt and encrypt functions. Please check the code"
                )

        def testing(self) -> bool:
            msg = "vishal"
            if self.decrypt(self.encrypt(msg)).casefold() == msg.casefold():
                return True
            return False

        def verify(self, plain_text, encrypted_message, is_encrypted):
            if not is_encrypted:
                return plain_text == encrypted_message
            return plain_text.casefold() == self.decrypt(encrypted_message).casefold()
```

The `testing` function automatically tests every cipher we implement by encrypting and decrypting the text "vishal", and if it does not match, it raises an error. This is a very important step in automated testing, and for ensuring that there is no change to the encryption or decryption function without throwing an error.

Using the tried and tested `pycryptodome` library, we ensure that these ciphers are implemented without any common vulnerabilities or attacks, like leaking of keys or text.

# Running the Python backend to test the ciphers

Make sure you have Python on your system. You can check by running `python --version` in a terminal.

1. Download the code using [this url](https://github.com/vishalnandagopal/pyjamas/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) or git clone the repo.

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/vishalnandagopal/pyjamas/
    ```

2. In the `pyjamas_forms` folder, open a terminal. Run
    ```
    python app.py
    ```
3. Open the URL given by Flask in a browser. It is usually [`http://localhost:80`](http://localhost:80).
